## Kahoot & ChatGPT: Dominate in a Kahoot game

## NOTICE
> :warning: :warning: :warning: **WARNING:** This project is an old version of KahootGPT. Please install the most recent KahootGPT version from a trusted source (e.g. Chrome Webstore/Firefox Addons) :warning: :warning: :warning:

### PLEASE READ:

> ⚠ API Key ⚠:
> <br>
> KahootGPT does NOT provide an OpenAI API key. For this reason, you will need to get your own OpenAI API key (OpenAI provides a $5 free credit for new users, this is enough for plenty of Kahoot games!).

> ⚠ OPTIONAL Paid features ⚠:
> <br>
> The only paid feature is Auto-tap, Auto-tap allows KahootGPT to automatically click the best fitting answer according to OpenAI's language models. The extension will run as normal without this purchase.

## About:
Introducing KahootGPT, a powerful Chrome extension that uses OpenAI's cutting-edge natural language processing capabilities to assist Kahoot players in achieving their best performance.

KahootGPT is an excellent tool for anyone who wants to improve their Kahoot game performance. Whether you are a student looking to improve your grades, or just someone who enjoys playing Kahoot games, KahootGPT can help you achieve your goals.

Overall, KahootGPT is an essential tool for anyone who wants to take their Kahoot game to the next level. With its powerful features and easy-to-use interface, KahootGPT is a must-have for anyone who wants to achieve their best performance.

## Usage:
KahootGPT is designed to make playing Kahoot games easier and more enjoyable for everyone. The extension can generate the four best possible answers for each question, making it easier for players to choose the right answer. Alternatively, KahootGPT can highlight the best fitting answer, helping players focus on the most accurate choice.

Moreover, KahootGPT can import questions from Kahoot page itself (assuming the host allows players to view the questions and possible answers), allowing players to use the extension with any Kahoot game. KahootGPT will generate four best possible answers or highlight the most correct one according to OpenAI's language model.

In addition to generating the best answers, KahootGPT can also auto-tap the correct answer for players. This feature is particularly useful for players who want to take a more passive role in the game, or for those who are struggling to keep up with the pace of the questions.
